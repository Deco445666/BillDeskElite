- name: Step Name
  uses: action/name
Both `name` and `uses` are keys of the step object in the `steps` list. So they must be at the same indentation level.

In the block above:
```yaml
      - name: 📤 Upload APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
This is correct. The `-` indicates the start of the list item (the step object). `name` is the first key. `uses` is the second key of the *same* object, so it aligns with `name`.

**Please delete everything in `.github/workflows/build.yml` and paste the code block above exactly.** This will resolve the syntax error.
